To make the disc\ndurable, paste a piece of transparent\nplastic sheet under the cardboard\ndisc. At the other end, touching the\nmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\nplate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this\nglass plate several small pieces of\ncoloured glass (broken pieces of\ncoloured bangles). Close this end of\nthe tube by a ground glass plate.\nAllow enough space for the colour\npieces to move around.\nYour kaleidoscope is ready. When\nyou peep through the hole, you will be\nable to see a variety of patterns in the\ntube. An interesting feature of a\nkaleidoscope is that you will never see\nthe same pattern again. Designers of\nwallpapers and fabrics and artists often\nuse kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\npatterns. To make your toy attractive,\nyou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\ncoloured paper."
